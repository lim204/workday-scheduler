## Work Day Scheduler
The main purple of thi project is to create a simple calendar application that allows a users to save events for each hour of the day.

## Functionality
1) When the user opens the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
2) When the user scrolls down, the time blocks show standard business hours.
3) Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
     * ![#d3d3d3](https://via.placeholder.com/15/d3d3d3/000000?text=+) `Past` 
     * ![#ff6961](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ff6961/000000?text=+) `Present`
     * ![#77dd77](https://via.placeholder.com/15/77dd77/000000?text=+) `Future`

4) User is able to click and enters an event into the time blocks
5) When the user clicks the save button for that time block, the text for that event is saved in local storage
6) When the user refreshes the page, the saved events persist.
